## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS


### What I learned

Since I used SASS in styling, I solidified my knowledge in the use of @extend, @mixin, @include rules to make styling seamless.

``sass (.scss)
proud of this

@mixin text_edit($font-size, $fontweight, $font-family){
	font-size: $font-size;
	line-height: 150%;
	letter-spacing: 0px;
	font-weight: $fontweight;
	font-family: $font-family;
}

```

### Continued development

I would work on using operators in SASS next
